# Common Lisp library to access Groq LLM service APIs Supporting Tool Calling

From my book URI: https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp

There is a **Makefile** in the repo https://github.com/mark-watson/loving-common-lisp that can be copied
to your **~/quicklisp/local-projects** directory. Then in **~/quicklisp/local-projects** run:

    make fetch

to get all of the library examples from my book.

## Note: this example is not yet in my book
