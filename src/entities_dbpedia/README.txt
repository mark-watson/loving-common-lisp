# Common Lisp library to resolve entities in text to DBPedia URIs

From my book URI: https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp

There is a **Makefile** in the repo https://github.com/mark-watson/loving-common-lisp that can be copied
to your **~/quicklisp/local-projects** directory. Then in **~/quicklisp/local-projects** run:

    make fetch

to get all of the librsary examples from my book.

try:

````

(ql:quickload "entities_dbpedia")

(setf
  an-entity-hash
   (entities_dbpedia:find-entities-in-text "Bill Clinton and George Bush went to Mexico and England and watched Univision. They enjoyed Dakbayan sa Dabaw and shoped at Best Buy and listened to Al Stewart. They agree on Rep√∫blica de Nicaragua and support Sweden Democrats and Leicestershire Miners Association and both sent their kids to Darul Uloom Deoband."))

(entities_dbpedia:entity-iterator
  #'(lambda (key value)
  (format t "The value associated with the key ~S is ~S~%" key value))
  an-entity-hash)
