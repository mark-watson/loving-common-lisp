# The code in this directory is not yet in my Common Lisp book

The code in this github repository is for the examples in my book [Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer's Secret Weapon](https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp).

I used to keep two different repos, one for my book and one for all of my Common Lisp experiments (including book example code). I decided to use one huge mono-repo for all of my own Common Lisp development.
