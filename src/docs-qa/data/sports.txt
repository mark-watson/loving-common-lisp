Sport is generally recognised as activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity. Sports are usually governed by rules to ensure fair competition and consistent adjudication of the winner.

"Sport" comes from the Old French desport meaning "leisure", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or entertaining".

Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity and exercise. For instance, the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise, including those completed just for fun.
