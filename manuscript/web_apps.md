# Writing Web Applications

                                NOT USED IN BOOK


We have already seen an example REST service returning JSON data and also a simple form demo using the **hunchentoot** library in the [Chapter on Network Programming](#network_prog). For this chapter I will continue using **hunchentoot** with a few more examples that should get you started writing web apps.

For much of my work I use the Ruby Sinatra library for writing REST web services and small web apps. This is the most agile software stack I have found. However the Ruby language for different types of applications can be [10 to 30 times slower than SBCL Common Lisp](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=yarv&lang2=sbcl&data=u32) so using Common Lisp and **hunchentoot** is worth serious consideration.


## Sample Application: Querying DBPedia Using the Lookup Service


## Sample Application: Ember.JS Web App With a Common Lisp Back End Service
