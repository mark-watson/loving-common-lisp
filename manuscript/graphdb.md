# Building a Graph Database Using Sqlite

I am going to be building on an open source project that handles Go and Python XXXX.

I have spent some effort in this book introducing you to RDF graph datastores and the SPARQL query language. The approach we take now has the advantage of only having the **sqlite** Common Lisp library dependency. We will also not have a query language and instead rely on free text search to find possibly useful nodes in a graph and then build up some capability for graph traversal.
