# notes from May 2020:

New material that I am planning:

- update to preface
- early in the book discussion of different available Lisps and when I use each of them
- a chapter on Design
- a chapter on KnowledgeGraphNavigator
- possibly add a CAPI GUI for KGCreator example
- expand plotlib.md chapter to include CAPI examples also
- py4cl.md deep learning examples
